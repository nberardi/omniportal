[2] Open IIS.
[3] Right click the name of the folder created in step 1 and select Properties.
[4] Click the Create button under Applications Settings.
[5] Click OK.

-- 2.1 -- Setting Configuration Files:
[1] Open Web.config for editing.
[2] Under the 'ManagedFusion' tag set the 'databaseConnectionString' if your database isn't on the localhost.
[3] Close and save Web.config.
[4] Open {portal root}\Communities\1\Community.config for editing.
[5] Under the 'settings' tag set the 'DatabaseConnectionString' if your database isn't on the localhost or the modules are stored in a different database.
[6] Under the 'provider' tag go to the 'Authentication' provider.
[7] Change the username 'admin' to something personal.
[8] Create a new GUID.  You can do this in VS.Net (Tools > Create GUID) or there are many resources on the net to do this for you.
[9] Create a password for this user.  You can do this by going to <http://www.aspnetresources.com/tools/pwdhash.aspx> and getting the hash of a password.  Make sure the password is in the same format as 'passwordFormat' on the 'credentials' tag.
[10] Under the providers tag go to the 'Authorization' provider.
[11] If you changed the GUID from above make sure you update the new GUID in the only user provided.  (This is the tag that gives the user defined roles.)
[12] Under the providers tag go to the 'Profile' provider.
[13] If you changed the GUID from above make sure you update the new GUID in the only user provided.  (This is the tag that gives the user profile attributes.)
